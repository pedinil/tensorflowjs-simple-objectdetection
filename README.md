# TensorFlow.js Object Detection with COCO-SSD

This project showcases how to perform object detection using the COCO-SSD (Common Objects in Context - Single Shot MultiBox Detector) model in TensorFlow.js. The COCO-SSD model is a pre-trained model that can detect and classify multiple objects in an image.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser

### Installation
1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/tensorflowjs-object-detection.git`
2. Navigate index.html file and give access to camera  


## Model Details
- The COCO-SSD model is a pre-trained model that can detect and classify objects in images into 80 different categories.
- The model is loaded using TensorFlow.js library functions.
- The model makes predictions on uploaded images and displays the results with bounding boxes.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML file displaying the image upload form and object detection results.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the HTML elements.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for loading the model, processing images, and making predictions.


## Acknowledgements
- This project utilizes the COCO-SSD model provided by TensorFlow.js.
- Special thanks to the TensorFlow.js team for their contributions.
